# Exercise 3
Read multiple FASTA sequences and perform a multiple sequence alignment (MSA).

## Dependencies
This exercise uses [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software) to perform the
alignment, and assumes the executable is in the PATH.  You can download it from the
previous link and if the program is not in your PATH you can point to it with a
command line argument. Run `ruby main.rb --help` for more information.
