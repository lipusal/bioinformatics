# Exercise 5
Use EMBOSS' API to calculate ORFs of a given nucleotide sequence, obtain possible
amino acid sequences, and download histograms of amino acid properties.

A sequence can be passed directly as an argument in FASTA format, or as a file.
If neither is provided, defaults to the [sequence from exercise 1](https://github.com/lipusal/bioinformatics/blob/master/lib/bioinformatics/tp1/ex1/NM_002049.gbk)
(converted to FASTA).
